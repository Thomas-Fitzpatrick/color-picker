# Color picker app

Deployed on Azure at: https://color-picker.azurewebsites.net/

This React app provides a simple interface to explore and copy multiple shades of colors from a selection of popular palettes. It supports copying colors in hex code, RGB and RGBA formats. New palettes can also be created and organised using the "Create Palette" option. It's fully responsive for multiple screen sizes and devices.

This project was based off the capstone project from Colt Steele's Modern React Bootcamp at https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/
It was developed using Github actions to handle CI/CD into Microsoft Azure.
Styling based on http://materialuicolors.co/.
